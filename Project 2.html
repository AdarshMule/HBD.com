  <p style="font-size: 30px;font-family:arial;color: black;"> There will be times when we will no longer see each other as often as we used to; there will be moment of ups and downs in our journey on the path of friendship; there will be time when the stormy weather of life will seem to break the bond between us and there will be moment when we would want to call it quit between us. I want you to know that I will not give up on us, at least not without a fight, because you are the best thing that ever happened to me in life and I would not trade you for the finest pearl in the world.You will always be my lifeline forever. </p>
